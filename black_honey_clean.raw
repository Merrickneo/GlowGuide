I love it. My mom loves it. It was my grandma’s favorite $T$ :) just wish it wasn’t 20$

My lip $T$ is naturally so light, so I like having tinted stuff I can layer to whatever thickness I need. I use black honey for weekends and usually burts bees red dahlia lip tint or neutrogena’s red tinted spf balm during the week so I don’t use it up too quick

I love the $T$ and was so surprised it is having a moment because it's been around forever. I just wish the staying power was better.

The $T$ is nice, for sure, but doesn't fit my light olive skintone. She is also asian but is a bit more tan so it looks amazing for her!!

I’m fair, no idea what my undertone is, but the $T$ doesn’t suit me :(

The $T$ doesn’t suit me (I have very cool fair skin and it looks warm/brown/sickly on me).

Color is beautiful on my skin tone (very fair) but it isn’t very $T$ I find myself needing to apply a chapstick underneath

I’m sure I’d love it but for practical and cost reasons I use Labello dark cherry. It’s got a great tint (probably a dupe) and keeps my lips $T$ all day. Plus it’s like 4 euros. Only downside is that it’s not as pretty in terms of packaging.

It's one of the few $T$ I've ever bought more than once. It's slightly darker than my real lip color so it looks good on me.

I love it. It’s my go to. Sheer but really complementary and the $T$ stays pretty well

I like it,  but it $T$ my lips out. I’m thinking I would like to find a hydrating shoe.

It's cute. I prefer pinkish colours but totally get the $T$.

I was happy my old $T$ was rereleased but it does not suit me anymore now my undertones are very warm and bright. Its too cool and mute for me now.

I have been around for a while and used black honey before it was famous ;) I liked it well enough, but  I think the buzz around it is manufactured. It is just OK and not necessarily for everyone. Is there a clinique counter near you to try it first? I would go with the cheaper $T$ options others have mentioned.

I love it. I’m Asian with yellow undertones and although it’s so expensive, I make it a point to stock up on it because it suits me so well and it’s the only lip product that I’ve ever gotten complimented on. And yes, I have the dupes and while they were okay, they were nothing compared to the real deal.
It’s sheer but buildable, longevity is fair (won’t survive a meal but definitely will survive drinking and vaping lol), and it’s super comfortable and moisturising too.

It's also not a great lip balm in that it's not $T$ at all.

Yes, I used to never buy it because I usually got it in free gifts but since they know it’s their most popular $T$ they’ve pretty much stopped ever having it as a part of a gift. It’s universally flattering.
