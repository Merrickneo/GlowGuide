I love it. My mom loves it. It was my grandma’s favorite $T$ :) just wish it wasn’t 20$

My lip shade is naturally so light, so I like having tinted stuff I can layer to whatever thickness I need. I use black honey for weekends and usually burts bees red dahlia lip tint or neutrogena’s red tinted spf balm during the week so I don’t use it up too quickshade1I love the $T$ and was so surprised it is having a moment because it's been around forever. I just wish the staying power was better.shade1I like it. I was expecting more due to all the hype it had online but I like it. Feels nice and suits most people. Doesnt last as much as I wanted to but it’s not a liquid lipstick so it’s normal I guess

It’s a nice product to have for when you are wearing little to no makeup, in your bag…lipstick0Bought it and ended up giving it to my friend.

The $T$ is nice, for sure, but doesn't fit my light olive skintone. She is also asian but is a bit more tan so it looks amazing for her!!color 1I’m fair, no idea what my undertone is, but the $T$ doesn’t suit me :(shade-1I hate it. 

The color doesn’t suit me (I have very cool fair skin and it looks warm/brown/sickly on me). 

And it has the same bad smell/flavor as when it came out eons ago. 

0/10. But fascinating that they revived it.Color is beautiful on my skin tone (very fair) but it isn’t very $T$ I find myself needing to apply a chapstick underneathmoisturising-1I’m sure I’d love it but for practical and cost reasons I use Labello dark cherry. It’s got a great tint (probably a dupe) and keeps my lips $T$ all day. Plus it’s like 4 euros. Only downside is that it’s not as pretty in terms of packaging.moisturising1It's one of the few $T$ I've ever bought more than once. It's slightly darker than my real lip color so it looks good on me.lipsticks1I love it. It’s my go to. Sheer but really complementary and the $T$ stays pretty wellcolor1I like it,  but it $T$ my lips out. I’m thinking I would like to find a hydrating shoe.dries-1Love it too! Have been wearing it $T$ 2014since1i love it! i wore it on my graduation day and got a ton of $T$ (light-medium skin neutral undertones)complimenrs1I brought into the hype. It does $T$ for me at allnothing-1It's cute. I prefer pinkish colours but totally get the $T$.appeal1I used to love it and repurchased many times in the nineties, when my undertones were cool. 

I was happy my old $T$ was rereleased but it does not suit me anymore now my undertones are very warm and bright. Its too cool and mute for me now.holy grail0I have been around for a while and used black honey before it was famous ;) I liked it well enough, but  I think the buzz around it is manufactured. It is just OK and not necessarily for everyone. Is there a clinique counter near you to try it first? I would go with the cheaper $T$ options others have mentioned.dupe1I love it. I’m Asian with yellow undertones and although it’s so expensive, I make it a point to stock up on it because it suits me so well and it’s the only lip product that I’ve ever gotten complimented on. And yes, I have the dupes and while they were okay, they were nothing compared to the real deal.

It’s sheer but buildable, longevity is fair (won’t survive a meal but definitely will survive drinking and vaping lol), and it’s super comfortable and moisturising too.moisturising1The thing is, it's not actually universally flattering though the internet keeps saying it is. It's dark and it's berry but kind of bruisy/wine stain berry and will look great on some but not on others. 

It's also not a great lip balm in that it's not moisturizing at all.moisturising-1Yes, I used to never buy it because I usually got it in free gifts but since they know it’s their most popular $T$ they’ve pretty much stopped ever having it as a part of a gift. It’s universally flattering.shade1
