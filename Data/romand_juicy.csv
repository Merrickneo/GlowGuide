8 Rose Stream - Glasting Water Tint

11 Pumpkin Brown - Glasting Water Tint (Hanbok) 

After acquiring an alarmingly huge collection of Romand tints from a sale they recently had, I found myself reaching for these colors the most. They tend to be MLBB on NC25-NC35 skin (my skin color) and unlike matte liquid lipsticks, I find they wear off very well and naturally throughout the day. I want fuss-free makeup that won't smudge under a mask and these are perfect. I put on 1 coat, wait a few minutes, blot then go on with the rest of my day."
Avery nice collection here! What I love about the Juicy lasting tints and the Glasting tints is that they are moisturizing. I don't need lip balm if I wear these. Bonus point is that they are somewhat transparent a d glossy so won't settle into your fine lines on your lips or emphasize them like many matte or velvet tints tend to do if you have dry lips.
Do you find that they all end up looking like the same shade of pink after a few hours? I love the way a tint looks on initial application but not how dark of a pink they look after  and i can't even reapply because the colour becomes too intense for me lol
Those are pretty colors! I have the juicy lasting tint in fig fig and I love it. It feels so nice on my lips.
Do you find that these tints are different color on the lips after some time passes (I‚Äôm particular curious about Almond/Rose Mulled Peach cause I really want a color like that)? I love Rom&nd tints so much but the one issue I have with the juicy tints are that they stain my already pigmented lips and after some time passes the original color which I so loved (very moody and special) just becomes red. I can never reapply these because of that and I‚Äôve tried foundation on the lips but once the lip wears off it just leaves the redness.
"Fantastic  ‚ù§

Any chance of a pic of how the stains look once the gloss wears off?"
which ones last the longest between the glasting and juicy?
"picked up a ton of tints from romand's juicy lasting tint line because i wanted to vary my under mask lip colors.

swatches were a little difficult to do because the colors, especially the lighter ones, are so dependent on the shade of your lips underneath, and the stain was far too good! i had a hard time removing colors between swatches so even though i loosely went from light to dark, i believe the later shades would look different on a nude lip.

i also took these photos in direct sun and i think indoors and in person, the color looks way more even, almost like you put some gloss over a rich matte lip. i love the formula a lot; it stains smoothly and still has a shiny finish. going to wear plum coke today and see how the fade is.

my favorite shades are litchi coral, jujube (mlbb on me), and the bottom row (corni soda, eat dotori, cherry bomb, and plum coke) because i'm a sucker for a darker lip.

figfig, jujube, eat dotori, and corni soda look very similar to me but i have a feeling the consecutive swatching + staining only added to the effect. i will try them on a totally nude lip over the next few days. 

edit: plum coke lasted through lunch well and i didn't need to reapply. it was definitely mostly gone after dinner time though!"
"I'm so glad you posted these! I've looked at a lot of swatches because of a haul I'm meticulously planning, but this one showed me just *how much* some shades are similar (or different!\*) when on. Thanks!"
yesss thank you. I really want Nudy Peanut but the swatches I see range from dusty brown-pink to bright orange.
"These swatches are so nice, thank you!!

How is the longevity of this?"
LOVE the darker shades! They work really well on you and I love your eye look too. Thanks for doing this!
"I just ordered this in jujube, so these swatches fill me with happiness! Thank you for doing this!"
where did you order from? all the colors look so great on you!
I love the natural unfiltered pictures. Thanks a lot.
Except Juicy Oh! The rest kinda look the same kind of pink on your lips in full face pictures.
"Thanks for all the hard work you put into this Queen!! You look fantastic, and these swatches have certainly convinced me to buy some too!"
Lychee coral looks the best on you in my opinion!
"Thank you for these swatches, I really appreciate this as I was looking into these products. 

&#x200B;

Which would you say is the most ""rose"" colour?"
"Wow, every single one looks great on you! I like eat dotori best, I think, but they really are lovely colors across the board."
It looks so nice AAAAAAAA btw does it leave a dry feeling on the lips?
Thank you so much for the swatches! This is what you call an actual swatch - w/ no filter & regular lightning :)
Thank you for these swatches! Nudy peanut looks like a natural MLBB!
"They're like kpop boys, they all look the same."
"I love these. After finding out about them through this sub I got Litchi Coral and Figfig. Both are really great, wearable colours (imo Litchi Coral is a perfect spring-summer tone and figfig will be amazing for autumn-winter) and the texture is so unique and hydrating without being sticky!"
How long does the stain last on your lips? Did you try eating with it and did it stay on afterwards or completely gone?
Not even gonna lie JUICY O is such a good color!!!
"These look amazing, thanks for taking the time to do this! Also question - what colours/palette did you use for your eyes? The shadows look stunning!"
Which one do you think is darker between figfig & jujube?
Great post! Thanks for the swatches
Wow! Thank you so much for the lip swatches!! You look amazing in them. I have figfig and am contemplating getting more now
I want all the colours haha
How do these wear under face masks?
One of the best reviews on Romand lasting tints! Thank you!
God these are all so beautiful. I love the way the juicy tint formula sits on my dry lips. Which one is your favorite?
I‚Äôm so in love with the color of these tints! Could I ask if Pomelo Skin happens to darken/get redder after the tint stains the lips (my life are on the pigmented side so other Juicy Lasting Tints always looks super red on me and just want to know if these do that too)?
"Hey all!

Several days ago I shared a review/swatches of the new Romand zero velvet tint vintage filter collection. I ended up picking up the new juicy lasting tint shades as well, so I wanted to share these swatches with you too!

The new juicy lasting tint collection is called ‚ÄúBare Juicy‚Äù inspired by fresh, juicy flesh colors of different fruits.

Texture is glossy and jelly-like with a cushiony finish. Not too sticky or greasy. 

There are 4 new shades for delicious candied lips:

- 22 Pomelo Skin (warm nude beige color, great base color for warmer undertones) 
- 23 Nucadamia (soft red brown color with a drop of rose)
- 24 Peeling Angdoo (red wine color with a tinge of grey/white)
- 25 Bare Grape (dusty rose pink with a hint of mauve)

I‚Äôve uploaded a full review vid including all 4 lip swatches & 4 tips for using them on my YouTube channel [here](https://youtu.be/kZPwtyuiizU) if you are interested. Hope it helps if you're considering purchasing them. Let me know if you have any questions. :)"
Yesss I've always wanted a nude lip tint because Korean lip tints are always too vibrant for my taste! Pomelo skin looks so good ‚ù§ does the colour deepen over time at all?
I love how you set up a beautiful background with fruit too!
This packaging is adorable
Ah here I go spending money again üò´
"Thank you so much for the review! I know zero about makeup, have recently started liking lip tints but know nothing about them haha. Pomelo skin is such a lovely colour that I'm really excited to get it ^^"
i loved your other video & this one was just as cute and really helpful! just subscribed ü•∞
Do these dry down and leave a stain ?
These are so cute!
Where did you buy them? So cute!
I just bought two of these last week and I love them! I‚Äôm not really sure but these aren‚Äôt sticky compared to their old ones and I like that. I got the shades Nucadamia and Bare Grape. I‚Äôm in looove!
"hi, is this long lasting too? like the other shades? i really like the colors but i want the stain to be long lasting since all my tints are just gone when i eat lol."
Every time i see that dark coconut i consider buying it. Gonna have to give in soon.
Nucadamia looks so dark and vampy on me when I swipe on with the wand (instead of using a few dots and blending with my finger)
"Ty so much for these üòª would you be able to do lip swatches? I think I have the same skin tone as you?

I find so many lip products just look bright pink on my lips :("
Ooh these look nice. I love brown tones.
Do these dry like a marker?
I have this EXACT collection and I am absolutely in love. Each one fits a different mood/occasion and just compliments my face without stealing the show. Great minds think alike üòå
"So pretty! I have nucademia,  I don't know if it's just me but it tastes terrible!!"
Thank you for the swatches! I currently have Almond Rose which I also love. I might purchase Dark Coconut next too.
I bought this exact shade and was pretty disappointed‚Ä¶wears off pretty fast and the texture is strange.
It's brownish on me and wears off pretty fast.
"I love how gorgeous this tint looks and the colour is a very flattering MLBB brown with a drop of red, but it does wear off pretty fast."
"Nucadamia is very MLBB on me, to the point I‚Äôm almost underwhelmed since I tend to prefer a slightly more standout Rose brown tone, it‚Äôs okay but I do agree it‚Äôs not too long lasting, especially vs some of the darker shades."
"Going against the grain here - Nucadamia my favourite shade. 

My foundation shade is Kosas tinted face oil in 3.5 and I like the warmth of the browny rosy pink tones which works best for my lip colour. 

Longevity wise, it lasts with drinking coffee, water, light snacking but anything more such as eating lunch or dinner - it‚Äôll come off but leave a light stain.  

I do find it drying so I always have a lip balm on hand once it dries down and the gloss is removed from eating and drinking. The only thing I initially didn‚Äôt like about it is that the smell and taste is a bit on the stronger side. To combat the weird taste, I use tissue to blot the insides of my lips to remove excess product.

Edit: A lovely redditor did a post a while back on this shade in case you‚Äôre also curious about the colour. It‚Äôs pretty spot on in person.

"Yup, and also, if your skin is brownish as mine, it won't be worth it. The shade is super nude, but the texture feels off."
"All 4 bare juicy have less ""tint"" power than the regular line. In terms of shine on my lips they last just as long imo, the difference is that with others when the shine is gone, the color stays. #25 Bare Grape is my HG mlbb glossy tint. It is the coolest in tone in the collection, the closest to rose, but it still has a hint of warmth. Followed by Peeling Angdoo, Nucadamia and Pomelo Skin in terms of warmth. I wear it almost everyday, and if I put it on after breakfast, it stays glossy until lunch. I only reapply after Ive eaten."
My fave go to. By far the most comfortable formula and looks very mlbb. However lasting power is not great (you'll need multiple reapps through the day) although it fades very naturally so it looks ok even if you don't reapply.
I find it quite long lasting! If ever you are interested in the full review or [discount from Olive Young](https://global.oliveyoung.com/if/rd?su=9DSJ4NLQ) (affiliated) feel free to check out my review on my [Youtube Video](https://youtu.be/B8PfYJ_Hc24). ü§ó
"Hello! I recently picked up quite a few of the Juicy Lasting Tints from Romand. I enjoyed the Glasting Water Tints and wanted to see what else they had. Like the Glasting Water Tints, with some shades there is only small differences between them, so if you need or want more pictures I am happy to provide them. This review has pictures of a ‚Äúwear test‚Äù and the shades swatched on my lips.

First swatch picture is natural outdoor light, second is the stains the tints leave behind. The Juicy Lasting Tint comes in a coloured plastic tube and have a doefoot applicator. I find these stain quite nicely and hold up well. You will need an oil cleanser to remove them at the end of the day. When comparing to the Glasting Water Tint, the Glasting Water Tint lasts better on me. I believe this is due to the formula; the Glasting Water Tint tints the lips with colour and has a clear gloss which when removed does not remove any colour, just the clear gloss. This is not the same for the Juicy Lasting Tints, which are all one colour/layer, so eating/drinking removes this glossy colour layer. In saying that, I do believe that the tint the product leaves behind lasts quite well, and they layer easily when retouching. I provided a ‚Äúwear test‚Äù here, first picture is freshly applied, then after coffee, after lunch, and that afternoon after coming home and eating/drinking without care (the tint comes off, but if you take care, it should last longer). Sorry about the bad lighting, pictures here: https://imgur.com/a/mWUFLld

I find the Juicy Lasting Tints to be less sticky from the get go than the Glasting Water Tints (note: the Glasting Water Tints don‚Äôt stay sticky for very long, this is just my observation). The Juicy Lasting Tints do have a scent, it is quite a strong sweet, fruity scent. You can‚Äôt smell it on the lips but after applying 11 shades I wished they were unscented haha. I prefer this colour selection to the Glasting Water Tints, and I find them a touch less glossy which I like. You can also blot the tints to take some of the colour away and be left with a really natural lip tint. Both tints settle into the lines on my lips if I haven‚Äôt exfoliated/moisturised them, but it is not extremely obvious. You can also make a gradient effect: https://imgur.com/a/WdIcKUq

Swatches ‚Äì I am 0n1 in Estee Lauder Double Wear. First picture is my lips without product so you can see how my lip pigmentation may affect the colour of the tints. Please note that I did try to remove the tint of each product before applying the next but it was very difficult. These swatches are all a fully saturated swatch, meaning that if you applied less product it would be less intense. Also, differences in colours of phone/laptop displays can change the ‚Äútrue‚Äù colour. Swatches here: https://imgur.com/a/29mVFkR

Edit 2: I bought these from Rom&nd's Gmarket. Usually I buy off Yesstyle, but as Rom&nd's Gmarket was having a 1+1 sale it was ultimately cheaper to buy from there, including the expensive post fee based on weight. I live in Australia.

Thanks for reading this far üòä I bought some of the matte tints too, if people would like to see them. I hope everyone is having a great day!"
"Thanks so much for writing up the indepth review and taking swatches of these! I've been on the lookout for an long-wear AB lip tint for the LONGEST time and I always see Romand recommended on this sub!  Would you say that the Glasting Water Tint lasts longer? 

I would really love to hear more about the matte tints that you bought if that's not too much trouble :) 

PS: you are very pretty, and the colours look SO nice on you!"
Thanks for the reviews and sharing your thoughts! It‚Äôs so interesting to see how the colours appear on different people. I haven‚Äôt tried the Glasting Water Tints yet but I‚Äôm looking to try them out sometime soon!
Thx for the write up and swatches! Where did you purchase these?
"I have the Figfig shade and I love it! Thank you for these swatches, this will help me decide what other colors I'd like!"
"ive been wanting to get a pink shade from this line for ages (i have 3 others) but without being able to swatch in-store, i didn't know which one to get. the arm swatch especially is super helpful for picking out the different tones! thank you so much for this. which shades of the glasting tint do you own, and do you happen to have any arm swatches of them? you look lovely in them by the way."
Cheers to you! I really appreciate the swatches on different skin/skintones/undertones. Not to mention the thorough review of the products!
"U are an angel for such an indepth review!!!! It is sooo hard to find swatches and pics of people wearing them all.

Also your eyebrows are üî•üî• and the colors all look amazing on you !!!! ü•∞üòç do you have an everyday fave so far??"
"Oh, I kind of wish I hadn‚Äôt clicked on this. üôà I just ordered a couple of the Glasting tints on YesStyle and am waiting for them to come in, but now I want a bunch of these. üòÇ Thank you so much for all of the swatches and info. I‚Äôll definitely bookmark this and circle back once I‚Äôve tried the others I ordered and need to place an order somewhere. Can I ask if you‚Äôre in the US and where you bought them? I‚Äôve never tried anything from this brand. I got into AB about 6 (?) years ago and went in pretty hard and still use several AB products in my routine, but always have a hard time with makeup because sometimes it‚Äôs difficult to find swatches. Thanks again!!

ETA: sorry, just saw you bought them from the Ronan‚Äôs Gmarket."
Ive been eyeballing figfig for a looooong time now üòç Im pleasantly surprised how cool toned rosy it is! Itll look amazing on my super pale skin! Thank you
[deleted]
Thanks! My skin is light-neural and I got nudy peanut expecting it to be more coral and nude but it‚Äôs so red on me üòÖ I‚Äôm having a hard time trying to figure out how to make it work for me.
"Wow! These look really good on you. 

I also have Jujube, Litchi Coral, Nudy Peanut, Pink Pumpkin, and Eat Dotori. I feel some of the colors, when applied to my pigmented lips are too similar to each other. For example Pink Pumpkin and Litchi Coral. Jujube turns out slightly darker than the other two on my lips, but still the same feel.

Do you notice a big difference between Jujube and Figfig? Figfig is the only other color I would like to get, but was sold out at the time. Not sure I will be getting them because I prefer velvet/matte nudes."
Anyone know of the best place to buy this that ships to Canada?
‰Ω†Â•Ω
