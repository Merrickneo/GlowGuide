"Thanks for sharing! Love to see reviews for lip products for darker skin, especially 2 toned lips like mine :)"
"Superrr excited for this review since these are my first korean lip products. I have warm toned skin but I'm not sure about my seasonal colour thingy. I'm still a beginner so take this with a grain of salt hehe
Let's start off with romand

Juicy lasting tint 
- These are definitely the most talked about liptints in the whole kbeauty industry. The packaging is really pretty and it has a fruity refreshing scent which isn't really strong. I could barely smell it once I've applied it on my lips. As the name suggests it definitely made my lips look juicier in a way. The tints are super pigmented and quite thick. When i applied two layers, I noticed that the tint lasted me the whole day, gradually fading but the hint of colour was still there. The gloss is very hydrating for the first few hours but after sitting in the AC for quite a while it does get drying. Once reapplied the colour gets a bit more saturated. Overall almond rose is definitely my favv shade. I was thinking of getting nucadamia but it was sold out :( I expected deep sangria to be a deep reddish brown colour but once applied on my lips it was more of a bright red colour which I wasn't really a fan of. However, the formula is honestly to die for

Etude house fixing tint 
- These were viral on tiktok and I finally managed to get them. As many of you know these tints are amaaaazing. It wasn't drying at all. I usually tend to avoid matte lipsticks but lawdd this is the only exception for now. If you have any recommendations for nondrying matte tints other than this pleasee leave me some in the comments. I loveeee the colour salmon brick on me and im hoping to purchase more soon heheh maybe ginger milktea since it reminds me of chai. We'll see. When first applied it goes on smoothly and then settles into a matte texture. I definitely recommend using a lip mask the night before applying this since it doesn't have a blurring effect."
The third one looks super natural on you!!
"Thanks for sharing this ‚ù§Ô∏è its always so difficult  to find swatches on darker skin tones. the colors all look great on you, i especially love the last one!"
[deleted]
Almond Rose looks great on u! Putting on my to-buy list!
"Thanks for the post! I have two-toned, pigmented lips like yours and this is very helpful"
I find this type of post to be more helpful then the arms swatches. highly appreciated!
Thanks for posting ! I love the first on you
"Really great swatch photos that you put together! I like how you showed the brand swatch and your bare lips for context. 

I have the almond rose and it‚Äôs my favorite of all the Korean lip tint colors that I‚Äôve tried. It doesn‚Äôt really stain my lips or last that long though. I need to reapply pretty frequently. I found that the Glasting tint stains my lips better. 

I really love the etude house salmon brick on you. Such a pretty color and so natural looking on you."
"I love seeing posts like this for darker lips, thank you it helps so much!!!"
Cute! How easy do they come off jw?
I just bought almond rose after seeing them on your review! I love it on you and the third one :)
"FINALLY! Someone with similar lips to mine, thank u so much for posting this girl!‚ù§Ô∏è"
Do neither of them cover lip pigmentation?
I LOVE your lip shape and the colour. The two tone is soo cute
"So helpful, thanks. Im eyeing the almond rose."
Please do more!
"I found the shade too nude and flat on me to be used on its own, but I do think it makes for a really pretty base (which was why I chose to show it as a gradient lip with Soft Walnut). I wish the color was a tad bit deeper to make up for the lack in vibrancy, as my skin tends to look dull when it lacks contrast.

I really like the soft brown fall aesthetic, but I think I need to finally come to terms that muted colors badly wash me out. :("
I love this kind of reviews! Thank you very much for doing it! ü•∞
"Such excellent swatch posts, thank you!!  I think I've bought at least 3 tints based on your swatches alone."
I think by adding the Soft Walnut you actually made it look closer to the ad swatch. The gloss on top is a nice touch and definitely looks better on you. Thanks for the swatch!
Ooooo I love that shade
Your lips are so pretty and modelesque üò≠‚ú®
"Wow these look beautiful, thank you"
do you find these drying at all?
Wow i need to get the sanho crush gloss now bc that‚Äôs my husband‚Äôs name hehe
i love your swatches :)
Really great swatch - I love the look when you layered it üòÉ
"Love this. I have the original colours and might need to add this one to my collection, I just love the formula so much."
Your lips are beautiful! They are all over my Pinterest ü§û
"Your well formatted swatches + reviews are always a great read! Been eyeing this shade as I've never tried a nude/neutral lip, but then EH just released a new shade that's light pink so my fixing tint purchase decision just never ends üòÇ"
I have been wanting the Soft Walnut but thought it was too dark. But now I see it goes on lighter. Thank you
ginger milktea is my fave shade and seeing this is soooo tempting bcos it gives you that natural almost undectatable wash of color. looove!
The soft walnut ombre looks soooo pretty! Do you find this drying at all?
An almost perfect mlbb!
"Does it stay long lasting even after adding the gloss ? (After you eat, drink..) thanks a lot dor your swatches they help a lot !!"
"Thanks for the swatch and review!
Love the gradient look on your lips!!

Did you find it still transfer proof after adding lip gloss?"
There‚Äôs something hilarious about all the cute and flowery names and then SALMON BRICK being there
"Cute, did you test out how long these last on your lips?"
Thanks so much for sharing! i love this lip tint. It is so good!! Dusty beige was my favorite but I love that rose latte color swatch. I may get this one
I put Soft Walnut on my wishlist to see how I like tints. I‚Äôve heard people seem to like these more than the Romand Juicy Tints.
"Ahhh, I didn't know that Rose Latte and Vanilla Cream existed! They're so pretty"
"i have dusty beige and love it - not really a fan of typical liquid lipsticks but i adore these.  i have smoky cherry on the way from yesstyle, too."
i have strong romantic feelings for the ginger milk shade
Are you in the US? Where‚Äôd you find vanilla cream? I‚Äôve had no luck finding it anywhere :(
"Dusty beige looked great on me. I'm a light to medium olive and cannot find many lip colours looking good on me (too warm, too cool etc etc)."
Im torn between repurchasing midnight mauve or getting the newer rose latte color üò≠
"Thank you!! I've been wanting to pick up your tints, but how long do they last?"
Great swatches. So many orange tone colors‚Ä¶ I want them all!!!
Thank you for these swatches! I have been thinking of checking out Salmon Brick and Rose Latte for quite some time now.
can u describe me the texture and finish? is it gel and matte?
those colors look like organ colors inside the body lol
What shade do you think will look good on NC42 ?
"Between this one and Amuse Dew Tint, which one would y'all recommend?"
Dusty beige is an exact match for my natural lip tone. Mlbb.
"Hope everyone‚Äôs staying safe and healthy. :)

I‚Äôve done a review & swatches for the Etude House Fixing Tint line, so I wanted to share it with you all.

There are 5 shades in the line and they‚Äôve been getting lots of attention for their new mask proof/smudge proof formula and pretty shades.

- Texture: When you first apply the tint it glides on smoothly and has a hydrating, creamy texture which you can smudge or move around easily. After 60 seconds or so the tint dries up and becomes matte and set in place. It doesn‚Äôt budge after the ‚Äúfixing‚Äù time. It‚Äôs not powdery or velvety matte, and it leaves a SLIGHTLY sticky feeling on the lips. I don‚Äôt find it drying on the lips given it‚Äôs matte. Etude House calls it the new ‚Äúhydro-matte‚Äù texture. 

- Longevity: These tints last for a very long time, I usually don‚Äôt have to reapply the tint when I go out for at least several hours, unless I drink or eat frequently (especially greasy things).

- Smudge/mask proof: I‚Äôd def say these tints do live up to the claim as ‚Äúmask proof‚Äù. Even after hours of wearing a mask, I see little to no marks left on my mask. However *IMPORTANT* remember to press the lips on a tissue a couple of times before putting on the mask to remove any excess and leave only the right amount of the product on the lips. If you put on a thick coat, you will probably see more smudging/more product coming off. So controlling the amount is crucial in preventing smudging.

- Staining: There‚Äôs a bit of staining left after removal (with a makeup remover), especially with the first 2 darker shades. 

Shades: 

- 01 analog rose: rose red muted slightly with a drop of white
- 02 vintage red: warm coral red with a tinge of cream
- 03 mellow peach: coral peach
- 04 ginger milk tea: nude ginger beige
- 05 midnight mauve: faded rose

All in all, I find myself reaching for these tints very frequently these days, because I love the shades, transfer proof formula and how long they last. My favourite way is to apply a thin coat with blurred edges. 

One downside is that all shades are pretty warm, so I hope Etude House will release some cool toned shades in the future.

I have a full review & lip swatches video [here](https://youtu.be/C3m2oeAJiEo) if you want to see these tints in more detail/worn on the lips in natural lighting.
Let me know if you have any questions. :)

Thanks for reading <3"
Thank you! I wish these tints would finally come to more stores that ship internationally. Have seen these on stylevana but don't think yesstyle carries them yet.
"does the tint have an unpleasant taste to you? i got one recently from jolse that has sort of a powdery/off taste, but i can‚Äôt tell if that‚Äôs just how it is or not. i had an etude lip products years ago that tasted fine so i was kind of surprised this one didn‚Äôt taste very good, but it also has been a while since i‚Äôve purchased anything from them!"
Ohh that's your video? I watched this a couple of weeks ago to decide which color to get. You're so pretty! Thank you for the high quality swatches!
Gorgeous picture! It looks like (or even better than) the official promo photos!
"I was waiting for this post after watching your video on it! I love how you swatch each shade and explain it in so much detail, and how the photos you take are so pretty. Thank you for the swatches and video! <3"
I love this too! But i def find myself reapplying it throughout the day especially after eating. I don‚Äôt eat anything with heavy grease or oil so not sure what I‚Äôm doing. How do you apply this to get the longest wear ?
This does not help my no buy üò≠ I want them all
"omg i've been wanting these so badly, time to bring out the $$"
"the photos are so pretty!! awesome swatches btw, thanks for sharing!! which shade is your favourite/most worn?"
"Oooooh, thank you! Can't wait to find these online üòà"
Wow your swatches are so pretty!
Omg I've been eyeing these tints since they launched! Thank you for the review ‚ô•Ô∏è
"Thank you for the video depicting the swatches irl and comparing it to the official promo photos, I already have#05 midnight mauve but #4 ginger milk tea also looks good.   

Which shade is your favourite?"
omg I like it
Came here just to say that the second photo was done so prettily! <3
"I really hate that something that seems mauve-y or dusty rose is still actually a red/peach/orange , I learned to never trust swatches or tubes, even when they say it's cool toned it's actually warm and I learned that the hard way"
I ordered the shade mellow peach yesterday. Looks so pretty! Thanks for the review! Now I am even more excited for this product
"I‚Äôm sold because of your video üòÖ I‚Äôm never a fan of lip tints because my lips are dry and pigmented but I might give these a go. 

PS: you look like the actress Lee Min Young in the new KDrama ‚ÄúLove‚Äù on Netflix! She plays Wong Won and I love her character ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"The applicator is angled and tapered at the tip which makes the application very easy. It picks up a bit more product than needed so make sure to take some of it off.

Hydro-matte texture according to ETUDE (It's not powdery). Very comfortable on the lips and doesn't dry them out. The texture is very lightweight, spreads very thinly which is something I really like, and glides on the skin easily.

You can build it up for a more intense color without it becoming heavy.

Stains the lips just a bit, but it's very easy to remove with a makeup remover/oil based cleanser.

There's enough time to move the product around and smudge it to make it softer or create a gradient look. Once it's locked in place it, it won't budge!

The shade that I bought: #03 Mellow Peach it's a coral peach color. Please note: I think it'll work better for those with warm undertones! This color at full intensity looks a bit odd against my skin. Hence why I always smudge it to make it softer and more muted.

The tint stays on for hours, although it will get removed faster if you eat greasy food. It's also transfer-proof!

I really want to try some other shades of this tint now. It def lives up to the hype. Have you tried it?"
"I have this tint in Dusty Beige. So long as I give it time to ""fix,"" it truly is maskproof and it's my favorite tint for everyday wear that doesn't dry out my lips. I hope they release a lighter cool pink shade for this line; I would snatch it up in a heartbeat."
"I love this lip tint! Someone on this sub recommended it to me, and I‚Äôm a big fan now, I‚Äôve even got a couple of friends hooked on these lol. I‚Äôve tried Dusty Beige (for every day use) and Analog Rose for when I need a bit of color. Love them both."
"That is one nice photo üòç If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, what camera do you use?"
"Dusty Beige is my favourite for daily use. I also have one of the Peripera fixing tints, but this time I think Etude did it better. The finish is prettier on the PP, but the Etude version lasts better and fades more gracefully when it does go. Both are really mask proof."
Super curious if anyone‚Äôs tried this and can compare the formula to the Nyx soft matte lip cream?
"I have all the colors available and I love them! Usually liquid lipsticks make my lips super dry and crack, but these are quite comfortable to wear. I can get a few hours wear before I feel the need to apply chapstick to rehydrate my lips. As a result, these don't last on me at all because I'm a chapstick-addict, so the moisture/slick from that just makes these disappear from my lips. But I do love them regardless! I don't find them super ""fixed"" though (pre-chapstick) because they still leave a minimal residue/stain when I press my lips on the back of my hands, blot on a napkin, etc."
where do you usually buy etude products?
Which websites do my fellow Canadians use to order etude products?? All I can find are American sites which are so expensive with the exchange rate and duty
"Looooove these!  I have two (dusty beige - perfect MLBB for me - and rose blending, which is a new one) but want to get smoky cherry, midnight mauve, and cranberry plum."
i must get my grubby hands on this product NOW
"i'm glad everyone likes this product! i randomly picked it up and they didn't have the one i wanted (dusty beige) - so i got analog, and i love it too!

definitely might end up becoming a collector of this product"
"i have this in cranberry plum & analog rose and i love it so much because its mask proof, transfer proof and very buildable. it doenst dry me up and i was just thinking of stocking up and buying mellow peach!"
"I can't really pinpoint why but I just absolutely love this tint! The first shade I got was midnight mauve, which is a pretty MLBB for me. I recently got it in Mellow Peach as it looked pretty unique, and it looks super cute IRL - it looks like the lip colour that snow (a photo editing app) filters give. Eyeing salmon brick, vintage red... and possibly even dusty beige next... üò≠üí∏"
Thanks for this wonderful review! I have the shade #12 Salmon Brick on the way and I'm excited!
"I have light cool toned skin tone and the vanilla cream looks gorgeous.  So hard to match the cool skin tone, so thank you for swatching."
"Wow it's even lighter and less saturated then dusty beige! Dusty beige in one layer is basically my lip color so I'm afraid vanilla cream will look too light on me :( but it's such a pretty and uncommon (for AB) color üòç
Thank you for the swatches OP ü•∞"
THANKS FOR SWATCHING!!!! I'M 100% GOING TO SNAP THIS UP NOW LMAO
"Vanilla Cream looks more cool-toned than I thought! It's supposed to be targeted towards warm-tones (particularly autumn mute), with Rose Latte being the cool-tone color of the collection. I'm intrigued now but I think I need to do more research."
"Weo vanilla cream looks great, thanks for swatch
Think itll fit cool skintone?"
I really like the Ginger Milk Tea shade! One of the few nude shades that are truly warm-toned.
"Omg finally something THAT ISN'T BROWN!

Do you find these moisturizing?

edit: The tens of other swatches I saw show it's brown. Back to searching I guess ."
"I like how neutral the new shade is, will definitely try to get my hands on it!"
Ooh this looks beautiful! I need to pick up ginger milk tea too
where can you find these??
These are so pretty!! but I feel like they would not suit me at all! Argh! Lol
Omg I've been scouring the internet for this - thank you so much!
Does anyone know where vanilla cream is in Stock in Canada? üò≠
Got really excited when my order for the new shades are in! Dusty Beige is what I had hope Midnight Mauve is: aka a cool tone muted mauve.
"Love Dusty Beige, though I fear it will be too light to show up. Thanks for swatches, this is very helpful, especially in comparison to midnight mauve. I somehow hoped midnight mauve would have more pink, it looks very orange."
"Soft walnut, midnight mauve and dusty beige are the only colours I'm interested in for this tint so thank you so much for swatching them side by side.
Dusty beige looks so good! How do you like the formula?"
Soft walnut looks wine-y üç∑ so nice!
Oh nooo not my favourite lip tint tempting me with new colours!!! Thank you for swatching!
Ohh thanks! Been eyeing the Dusty Beige but it's tough to find good swatches.
"They look stunning! Just ordered these exact shades, can‚Äôt wait!"
Omg. These shades are gorgeous. Thank you for the swatches!!!
Oh my god the colors are so prettyyyy Im dying
Thanks for the swatches! I already have Midnight Mauve but now I'm wanting Ginger Milk Tea and Dusty Beige.
Is anyone else tried ordering from Yes.com? I never tried though I had these two shade's in my basket for age's - are they trustworthy? I'm in the UK~
