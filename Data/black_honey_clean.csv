"I love it. My mom loves it. It was my grandma’s favorite shade :) just wish it wasn’t 20$

My lip shade is naturally so light, so I like having tinted stuff I can layer to whatever thickness I need. I use black honey for weekends and usually burts bees red dahlia lip tint or neutrogena’s red tinted spf balm during the week so I don’t use it up too quick"
I love the shade and was so surprised it is having a moment because it's been around forever. I just wish the staying power was better.
I use this [Elf Black Honey Dupe instead](https://www.elfcosmetics.com/sheer-slick-lipstick/82158.html?utm_content=gpla&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIu5DUguXV-gIVCbLICh3pjgWpEAQYAiABEgKMNPD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds)
"I like it. I was expecting more due to all the hype it had online but I like it. Feels nice and suits most people. Doesnt last as much as I wanted to but it’s not a liquid lipstick so it’s normal I guess

It’s a nice product to have for when you are wearing little to no makeup, in your bag…"
"Bought it and ended up giving it to my friend.

The color is nice, for sure, but doesn't fit my light olive skintone. She is also asian but is a bit more tan so it looks amazing for her!!"
"I’m fair, no idea what my undertone is, but the shade doesn’t suit me :("
"I hate it. 

The color doesn’t suit me (I have very cool fair skin and it looks warm/brown/sickly on me). 

And it has the same bad smell/flavor as when it came out eons ago. 

0/10. But fascinating that they revived it."
Color is beautiful on my skin tone (very fair) but it isn’t very moisturizing I find myself needing to apply a chapstick underneath
I’m sure I’d love it but for practical and cost reasons I use Labello dark cherry. It’s got a great tint (probably a dupe) and keeps my lips moisturized all day. Plus it’s like 4 euros. Only downside is that it’s not as pretty in terms of packaging.
It's one of the few lipsticks I've ever bought more than once. It's slightly darker than my real lip color so it looks good on me.
I love it. It’s my go to. Sheer but really complementary and the color stays pretty well
"I like it,  but it dries my lips out. I’m thinking I would like to find a hydrating shoe."
Love it too! Have been wearing it since 2014
I’m ready to throw out all of my other lipstick. I never thought I’d say this but I’m 27 and I think I found my signature color and I don’t feel the need to change it up to match outfits/looks. All I need is black honey.
i love it! i wore it on my graduation day and got a ton of compliments (light-medium skin neutral undertones)
I tried it in the 90s and hated it
I brought into the hype. It does nothing for me at all
It's cute. I prefer pinkish colours but totally get the appeal.
"Doesn’t work for my coloring. It does nothing for me. I’m a high contrast biracial Hispanic with bright seafoam green eyes. My coloring is very icy with bright coffee milk color complexion, thick black brown hair. It looks like mud on me especially since my lips are naturally raspberry pink. The warm red tone looks at odds with my hot pink mouth. I feel for women with a certain warmth somehow it works so much better. I’m one of those people that can only rock fuschia or true blue red lips. I can’t do any muted or “natural” (nude or brownish) makeup since it looks dirty on me. I thought I was being picky or wiggy about these things but every time I’ve tried it people tell me when I wear Black Honey or muted lips that l look depleted or sick. Besides my own natural lips the best lipstick color for me is Chanel ”Pirate”. One little dab of that makes my own natural color look a dramatic red pink that just looks like my lips did when I was a kid. Full on it makes me look lethal and eyes look sea-glass like. Almost like contacts. Either way works for everyday in my case as I am one of those people that needs the scary colors to look normal. My art teacher in HS said I was a “True Winter” in the color system. Black Honey does nothing for my mom either who is a “Dark Autumn” in the seasonal analysis system. She’s caramel toned and radiant looking. It honestly doesn’t do anything to the point it might as well be Vaseline. However on my bestie who’s coloring is like Veronica on Riverdale Black Honey is so pretty. It makes her lips and cheeks look flushed as if she spent a heavy make out session. I find is also works for red haired women and women with honey blonde hair (on these two is where Black Honey excels)."
"I used to love it and repurchased many times in the nineties, when my undertones were cool. 

I was happy my old holy grail was rereleased but it does not suit me anymore now my undertones are very warm and bright. Its too cool and mute for me now."
"Doesn't look good on me at all unfortunately - looks purple/brown (warm undertones in skin, fair to medium)"
In the Almost Lipstick format? Love it. I’m very fair/neutral-cool.
"I have been around for a while and used black honey before it was famous ;) I liked it well enough, but  I think the buzz around it is manufactured. It is just OK and not necessarily for everyone. Is there a clinique counter near you to try it first? I would go with the cheaper dupe options others have mentioned."
"I love it. I’m Asian with yellow undertones and although it’s so expensive, I make it a point to stock up on it because it suits me so well and it’s the only lip product that I’ve ever gotten complimented on. And yes, I have the dupes and while they were okay, they were nothing compared to the real deal.

It’s sheer but buildable, longevity is fair (won’t survive a meal but definitely will survive drinking and vaping lol), and it’s super comfortable and moisturising too."
"Something to keep in mind is that when black honey first became popular in the mid 90s, there just weren't really a lot tinted balms or sheer lipsticks like we have now. It was quite unique for its time, but there are similar if not better products out there now for cheaper."
Elf hydrating core lip shine in Ecstatic is a good dupe if you want to try a cheaper option first
"The thing is, it's not actually universally flattering though the internet keeps saying it is. It's dark and it's berry but kind of bruisy/wine stain berry and will look great on some but not on others. 

It's also not a great lip balm in that it's not moisturizing at all."
I have it and I love it! It gives my lips a little color and lasts longer than my typical burt’s bees tinted lip balm and it’s better than the others i’ve used from dior and lancome.
"Like people said, it's a tinted lip balm. One bite of lunch, one sip of water or a couple licks and it's gone. For the price, not worth it. Elf has a sheer lip balm in a shade called black cherry or something and it's often tauted as the best black honey dupe; most people actually prefer it. I have it inGolden pear and like it. But honestly, I wouldn't consider shelling out more than the couple of quid that costs because I'd want something longer lasting for they money, even on sale for 15 quid."
"Yes, I used to never buy it because I usually got it in free gifts but since they know it’s their most popular shade they’ve pretty much stopped ever having it as a part of a gift. It’s universally flattering."
"I was a teenager during the first wave of Black Honey hype and have always felt oddly vaguely guilty for not loving it as much as everyone else - my coloring is weird, and Black Honey looks either brown or orange on me which ... no. They briefly had a shade in the same line called Blackberry, and \*that\* stuff was magic, but also ultimately - as everyone else has said - tinted lip balm.

There's nothing extraordinary about any of it, I don't think."
"It's pretty dark for a lip balm.

Used to be huge when Clinique first started in the 70s. It came in a cute little pot back then."
"I've honestly never been without one since the 90s. probably my most purchased makeup product. I don't think it is as universally flattering as they say.

There are probably some food dupes but I like the slim case and the formula"
I got it but it doesn’t work on me. Feels like a glorified lip balm. The tint doesn’t stay long as well.
"I didn't know about the tiktok hype, but this is the only makeup product from Clinique that i have ever kept. I don't normally like their makeup, but this lip tint doesn't dry out my lips, and the color is just right on me. Doesn't bleed either.
EDIT: that being said, I don't know that I would pay for it. I got it free with purchase a while back :)"
"I personally love,love love Clinique. But I adore this lipstick/gloss/tint. I always have some on the way and I have gifted it to girlfriends for their bdays or Xmas of all races and it seems that all skin tones are a perfect background to ""Black Honey""."
"Everyone swears by this and says it matches every skin tone. I had a friend that used to work at a Clinique counter and she raved about it all the time and had me come in and try it on. It looked AWFUL on me, to the point that even she agreed it was pretty bad and that I shouldn't buy it. So if you happen to be fair and neutral/cool skin with blue eyes and brown hair, I would definitely steer clear."
I tried it and it didn’t impress me any more than the Burts Bees tinted lip balms. It’s just a sheer tint in a neutral tone
I got it and didn’t love it.
"I'm not very up on makeup, just getting back into it after a few years' hiatus and this looks exactly what I've been looking for.  I've wasted so much money lately on my search for a glossy, go everywhere colour.  So I ordered one, thanks.  I do like Clinique so I'm excited!"
"I like the tinted balms from Dr. Lipp, though I don't know if one is as dark as black honey."
No. It is like a tinted balm. I wore it my entire junior high career and it was too dark. I’m Hispanic. So it’s a no for me. I have a tinted lip balm that was maybe $4 that works the same - chapstick total hydration tint
"It's a nice natural sheer balmy deep colored lipstick. 
I loved it because I could put it on without a mirror and it added a little life to my pale lips.  
There's probably slightly cheaper dupes out there."
I found it drying.
I don’t dislike the black honey but I get the same payoff from the Honest Beauty tinted lip balm line and they’re cheaper.
"No, but pink honey is."
"i purchased it in a set with pink honey for $9 and it just okay. there are lots of good korean beauty brands that make similar products, or elf has some sheer lipsticks/balm style lip products that give a similar effect."
Nivea blackberry looks exactly like black honey and feels even better IMO.
"Honestly I really like the initial tint it it fades super fast and leaves my lips looking way too pink. Honestly for the money the Fresh ""Sugar Honey"" lip balm is a better balm and the color is similar in tone (at least on me) but doesn't turn my lips pink!"
it's an old favorite.....I hadn't thought about how old exactly until I realized that the reason I'd initially checked it out was because I'd read somewhere that they used the color on Liv Tyler in The Lord of the Rings movies 😄  The color really is pretty for a YLBB look.
[removed]
Nope.
"Yes, it’s my go-to YLBB. But I’m a huge fan of sheer lipsticks."
"my mom has used it for a long time, apparently it’s pretty good"
"Get it and try it!  If not you'll keep thinking about it.  If you can return it if it doesn't work well or isn't the right shade for your skin, go for it.  I'm always tempted to buy things if they have food packaging or names.  I googled this color but it's too dark for me unfortunately."
Yes!!! I love it sm
Dried the hell outta my lips dude
The Clinique chubby sticks are a lot better imo. The shades Fuller Fig and Whole Lotta Honey are gorgeous.
"I got it for Christmas and I love it. For me it’s the perfect your lips but better on my lips colour/skin tone. However, would I have gone out and bought if for myself? Probably not. But now that I’ve got would I recommend it? Yeah. If you want it get it but there are also other products that are very probably a similar colour and lower in price if that’s a concern."
"Honestly I would say you better put your money somewhere else, though, if it’s really cheap and you’re really curious, it might be your time to try it"
"The Sephora brand honey lipgloss is just as good as the Black Honey gloss, and you can often snag it for $3."
"I got it for Xmas, and apparently it was hard to come buy and my mother was only able to get me a smaller sample size. It's been lasting me awhile and I love the color! BUT, Burt's Bees has a tinted chapstick line that is way more hydrating, flattering colors (imo), and of course cheaper dupe.
The color ""dahlia"" in their tinted chapstick line is the closest to ""black honey"". I probably wont buy ""black honey"" again because of this, just slightly too ""thicc"" of a consistency for my dry lips also."
"I had an Almost Lipstick in the 90s that my grandmom got free. It was a brighter red, not Black Honey, but I remember I LOVED IT. 
I recently scored a free one myself IN Black Honey and it never leaves my purse. My lips never get dry and flakey after wearing it. I plan on trying to find the color I had as a kid!"
[removed]
"In my opinion - No. 
It’s tinted lip balm. It doesn’t show up on some people at all and on me it looks like bruised lips. It is NOT worth it and many brands have tinted balms with many different colors so you can pick for far less. 


Don’t pay 15 POUNDS a for a lip balm!  I have some expensive high end makeup. I use la mer stuff and the price of that is insane so I’m
Not anti good makeup at high cost but you’d be disappointed because it chapstick with a dark dark tint that doesn’t flatter a lot of people no matter what anyone says. Tik tok videos I’ve seen on it are filmed using filters that line and alter the lips and alter how that even looks so you are mostly seeing the filter and this lip balm isn’t gonna do that to your lips. Do not fall for makeup trends. You will feel silly after you realise that just because someone on tiktok likes it you bought it and you know yourself if you typically love tinted lip balms or wear things with dark dark  tint. Would you usually like black lipstick? Dark purple?  Ask yourself that. I wasted so much money on makeup back i. The influencer makeup community heyday. Never again. I feel so stupid. It was so stupid. 

I think most will be disappointed with it. There’s nothing special about it today."
"Oof. Black Honey does look great on both my mom (fair-light, cool peach) and me (very fair, muted yellow), but it looks very different on each of us at the same time. It's an MLBB for me and a fairly bold red-brown lipstick on my mom. We joke that we really only need one tube between us because we're never looking to wear it at the same occasion. 

At the same time, **""universally flattering"" is just an absolutely horrible marketing term that I wish would be eradicated**. I've definitely fallen hard on the wrong side of many ""universally flattering"" products in the past."
I actually prefer the Burt's Bees 'clone' Red Dahlia. I find the hue to be very flattering with my skin tone. I'm a very fair neutral to cool yellow that turns olive in the sun.
"Can I just say your post just took me back to the Clinique glory days in the nineties, where it was just *the* most sought-after brand, introducing us to a three-step skincare regime 😊💭 *sigh*

I wanted everything they ever released for quite a few years, I’m still not past thinking they’re ‘so premium I could never afford that’ 😂"
"I still love how Black Honey looks on my lips, almost as much as I did in the 90's but it now dries my lips out so much that I look like a weirdly old Victorian child who's dying of consumption and who will definitely come back haunt your make up bag when it dies. I tend to stick to Burts Bees Red Dahlia from day to day and Black Honey for Halloween:)"
Lmao why is this post marked NSFW?!?
Idk if anyone else remembers this but when they very first released black honey there were 2 others in the launch.  Same sheer formula but one was a berry and one a nude.  Dont remember shade names but that sheer berry was my absolute ride or die as long as the tube lasted.  Unfortunately the black honey was the only one that stayed on as a permanent product.
"Oh man, I’m cool tones and fair, nw15 in mac and I LOVE Clinique Black Honey.  It’s like a nice tinted balm and looks fantastic on my, a mlbb.  I do have fairly pigmented lips."
It looks godawful on me!!
I’m super pale but have warm undertones. Black honey looks fantastic on me. I have a friend though with a strong cool undertone who didn’t care for it.
"I tried Black Honey back in the late 90s or early 2000s and it was not pretty.  I have enough pigment in my lips that the red fades away and all that is left is an unflattering shade of brown.  

For a short period of time, Clinique expanded the Almost Lipstick range and their Almost Pink was my perfect shade of pink.  I mourned that lipstick getting discontinued.  And I have never been able to find a dupe."
"I bought a tube last year based on the hype. It's an awkwardly dark, off-putting berry on me. The most charitable description I can give it is ""gothy,"" which is not a look I've tried for since 1999. The texture is decent, but it's got plenty of competition on that front - Fresh and Kosas are standouts for me in the tinted balm category, and they have the benefit of an actual selection of shades."
"First off, my biggest pet peeve in makeup is the term ""universally flattering"", which everyone knows is actual BS because there's no such thing as one shade for everyone.  Second, I've been wearing Black Honey Almost Lipstick for over 20 years.  The brownish berry color is sheer and neutral enough that it can go with almost every look.  I often feel like I need a lip color of some sort to finish a look and this specific one does that effortlessly.  It's like a quasi my lips but better shade."
"Motor oil xD I know exactly what you're talking about. Or maybe axle grease!

I'm fair and cool toned and it looks ok on me. Not great, not bad, just okay. Like a sheer wash of burgundy, maybe, but my lips are naturally quite red - so much so that I use the grey balm by Stila to tone it down most of the time. I can definitely see it magnifying certain tones and making them into unflattering colors, though."
Tried it several times. Looks terrible on me too.
"I'm going to evangelize because I *loved* BH. 

I'm fair neutral with very pigmented lips, and the search in the 90s for a lip color that wasn't too heavy and didn't make me look like a corpse was real. I'd been stuck with heavily pigmented lipsticks with names like ""berry"" and ""spice."" Anything nude or pink-toned made me look dead, and anything coral-toned made me look like a Floridian grandma whose thick lipstick was about to transfer to her teeth.  

A sheer brownish berry was revelatory and so flattering on me. I loved it so much, I'd probably still be wearing BH regularly if the formula had any staying power."
It looks like dead blood on my lips. And not in a good way.
Haha. This made me laugh because I did the same thing! Repurchased several times thinking it was just my own poor judgement. Amazing how we fall for these ideas. I found the formula also gathered horribly in my lip lines so not only was the raisin colour unflattering it wasn’t even uniform.
"I absolutely love Black Honey! It makes me look alive lol. It hasn't been available in my country for years unfortunately, only online in UK webshops (pricy delivery and custom fees, thanks Brexit). I now use the Honest tinted lip balm in plum drop which is not really a dupe but fairly similar on my lips. Really happy I found an alternative, I don't look like a sickly Victorian child anymore!"
I loved it in the 90s and haven't worn it since. I have an entire drawer full of lipstick so ...I don't see myself going back to it.
BH did nothing for me.  Ages ago Clarins made a sheer that was more red. It was pretty but pricey.
"I love Black Honey, it just looks like a rosy lip tint on me though. I wear the black honey cheek pop as well and I just find it very flattering on my super warm toned skin.

Side note, can you explain ""cool yellow"" skin tone? I didn't that could be possible, I thought those two would be oxymorons in makeup terms. :0"
Pink Honey is where it’s at (when you can find it).
Courtney Cox always wore BH on Friends. It's supposed to look good on everyone which may be true depending on how thick you apply it. The consistency is of a lipstick but it's sheer.
Marajuana juicy lip is way more glossy and hydrating but Clinique black honey is a gorgeous unmatchable bright berry shade~
"I’ve been wearing black honey since it came out in the 1990s and it’s my “daily wear” lippie. I e never tried the tarte you mention, but I may need to look for it now!"
"Black Honey is not hydrating at all. The Tarte is pretty comfy. And if it’s something that matters to you, Clinique conducts animal testing, Tarte does not."
"It's not very hydrating, which is a bummer, but it's pretty. I got it for Christmas last year and I really like it."
"They are completely different types of lip products. I love both and have been enjoying the black honey more so.  Black honey has the consistency of a lipstick with sheer to light color payoff.  The maracuja lip is almost glossy/lip oil in feeling.  Both provide sheer color payoff.  If you have dryer lips and crave a glossy/oil look and feel then I suggest Tarte.  If you crave a lipstick feel and no lipgloss feel then go with black honey.  

I personally love the look of oils and gloss but hate the feeling of them so I lean to the black honey.  I hope you found this helpful"
"I wish I could find a proper, real lipstick the color of Clinique’s Black Honey. Love the color but hate the sheerness. I have to pile it on to achieve enough color to suit me."
i love black honey its so smooth and the color was just right
I love it. It's a classic.
I’m pale with a neutral tone and this is my daily lip product. It’s super easy to apply without a mirror and really just feels like a balm. I wouldn’t say it’s super hydrating but it doesn’t dry me out and I am a dryyyyy person. It gives a nice sheen so its great for daily wear.
"I own both and definitely prefer the tarte one. I know this is an unpopular opinion, but Black Honey doesn't look good on me and doesn't moisturize my lips very much. The tarte gloss tastes good, has a slight tint, and fills in my lip lines. My vote is for tarte!"
I just bought it and agree with the others that have said that it's not that hydrating but looks pretty
"I'm cool-toned and it pulls quite warm/orangey on me. If you lean more neutral or warm, I'm sure you'll have more luck!"
I just got it recently and I really like it! Perfect for every day
"People say black honey is not very hydrating, but it’s also not drying! It’s comfortable on me and it’s pretty. But I’m not sure it lives up to current TikTok hype."
Waste of money.
"I really like black honey. I find it comfortable to wear and like the sheerness. My only issue with it is that because it is sheer, doesn’t last very long. Have to reapply a lot."
"iPhone it for decades. Keep one in my purse and one in my makeup drawer I like the sheer Ness of it but every once in a while, wish they sold the same color in an actual lipstick so it would stay just a bit longer."
"I haven’t tried black honey, but it looks more like a lipstick to me, whereas Tarte is a very sticky lipgloss consistency."
"Not a fan of Black honey. Either there's no color at all, or I use so much that it settles in the lines of my lips and makes them look cracked and bleeding. I would recommend sticking with what you have"
"I like Black Honey as it’s vampy without looking too much on me. Altho like others have said, it’s not super moisturizing so I have to apply it over lip balm (which I don’t mind)."
"I hate the Tarte Maracuja colors, I have tried several and they always look meh.  


I really don't think any is comparable to Black Honey which I have worn since high school in the early 90s on and off. I don't find black honey drying."
"Not worth it for me.  On me it's really sheer - definitely less pigmented than the promo photos.  It also doesn't last very long.  There are much better balms out there, in my opinion."
I LOVE mine. I wear it every day to work and put on extra for dates/special occasions. The color builds really well for me.
Clinique lipsticks are really nice
I like it. If you like something a bit glossy and sheer it’s gorgeous but if you want something matte or more opaque skip it.
"I wear mine every day, very comfortable, pretty."

i finally caught black honey in stock at sephora last week and i am OBSESSED with it! i normally dont like lipstick but i will say its such a gorgeous shade that would look good on any skintone and can build well!
Merit has a new lipstick that looks identical to black honey!
E.L.F’s sheer slick in Black cherry is similar but way better. More pigmented and lasts longer!
"i found the same when i tried it and i tried it within the last year. if you add a clear gloss over it, it definitely makes it last longer. the closest dupe i could find was the elf hydrating core lip shine in the shade “ecstatic”. a little bit of a different texture because it’s more moisturizing, so it’s not as dry obviously, but as far as color, it’s pretty spot on. i like that’s it’s more moisturizing."
Milk had a berry colored lip balm that was so much longer lasting and similar color but I can’t find it for sale now. Its a lip balm called “kush” hope you can find it.
I got a sample tube of it and don’t understand the hype. Barely any pigment. I know it’s a balm and not a lipstick but I didn’t think it would be that sheer. Also disappears on me after 10 mins. I threw it out.
RMS beauty in Twilight lane is similar.
Maybe try a lip liner in the same shade and use it all over your lips. When the lipstick wears down the lip liner (usually) stays
"Yeah it has awful longevity and is not very hydrating. Of course the colour shows up differently depending on one's skin tone, but for me a good dupe that lasts so much longer is CT ""walk of no shame"" superstar lipstick (it's a bit more reddish than berry though). Or the CT ""happiberry"" shade of the hyaluronic lip balm- it is a very similar shade and last for hours. The superstar lipstick has that same balmy finish, and the hyaluronic balm is thicker than blackhoney, but has the best longevity (only issue with the HA happikiss is that the packaging kinda sucks- you can't twist it back down).

A cheaper and long lasting dupe is the Milk Makeup lip balm in plushberry. But the Milk lipbalm does have a minty scent so if you dislike mint in lip products then avoid."
"You could try vaseline rosy lips. Lasts a fair amount of time, far cheaper, and checks the box for that barely there natural looking colour."
"If you have access to CoverGirl, the Clean Fresh lip balm in Bliss You Berry is a dupe for both color and texture, but it's a little more hydrating and long-lasting on me. 

In general, this has a drier feel than most balms (which, for me, allows it to last much longer than most tinted balms) but it should still be emollient. It's possible you got a bad tube."
