"I love it and my skin loves it. It almost makes up for Missha reformulating my HG sun gel. 

It's all about finding which ingredients your skin dislikes. And unfortunately the only way to do that is try shit. It took me several cleansers to discover my skin hates mineral oil."
"BoJ sunscreen broke me out within 3 days of using it. I’m talking like 5 new pimples where I hadn’t experienced breakouts in several weeks. I’m combo skin (oily t zone and normal/dry everywhere else) and acne prone. I was honestly so bummed because I really like the finish and feel of it (sinks in pretty quickly/no white cast/satin finish (not too greasy or matte) but the breakouts are a dealbreaker for me. I suspect it’s the kelp extract which is highly comedogenic for some people and I’m unfortunately in that group. I’ve been using it on my arms, hands and chest and so far no issues there but I doubt I will be repurchasing once it’s finished. 

With that being said - I still recommend you trying it out for yourself! I’ve read many instances where people who are acne prone don’t have issues with it causing breakouts."
"I love it. I haven’t had an reactions or breakouts from it. It is a very comfortable sunscreen to wear however I have seen reviews from some who experienced a bit of skin sensitivity when applying. 





I would check out the ingredients and reviews to ensure it’s not something that will trigger your skin. It’s hard to say without trying first but hopefully it can help you a bit 🥰"
I broke out every time I used this. It’s a shame because it is such a nice sunscreen. I suspect it was the fermented rice because the BOJ sunscreen has the same filters as the Round Lab Birch Juice sunscreen and I can tolerate that just fine.
"I haven’t broken out from it. It leaves a really good glow that goes away after a few hours and takes quite a while to settle in, at least with my climate and skin type (humid + prone to oiliness). Cleans off really easily and does not stain clothes (so far). Also love how so much beneficial ingredients are incorporated inside it. I like it but not necessarily to the point of repurchasing.

Also I’ve heard that it’s very similar to Round Lab’s sunscreen, just with different star ingredients (birch vs rice). If BOJ doesn’t work for you, Round Lab is a great alternative for a similar finish and vice versa."
i break out from literally everything and anything (especially any sort of plant oil ingredient squalane included) and the BOJ has been totally fine for me.
"I just tried it for the first time after seeing all the hype and…. It’s not really for me. It leaves a white cast (I have warm yellow tone medium skin), and it causes my eyes to water if I get it too close to my eye area 😬"
it didn’t break me out! i use it but it’s not my favorite - prefer the isntree hyaluronic acid sunscreen. i keep it by my back door in case i run outside lol.
I love it. Truly the only sunscreen I know of that has great skincare benefits.
"It didnt break me out, but it pills on my skin so I stopped using it"
"I love hate BoJ sunscreen.. it did broke me out. Most probably because of the niacinamide. My skin can’t tolerate it. But I love the finishing. It make my skin look glowy and no white cast. I have dry skin and it feel great on my skin except for the breakout.

1st time I’m using it feel a bit sting on my skin. But after awhile it goes away. Few days later my skin totally breakouts. Only then I check the ingredients and realise it have niacinamide.

Just check the ingredients 1st before you use anything or do patch test."
No I LOVE that shhhhhh
"I just bought it in my most recent stylevana order - currently waiting for the package!

That being said, I’m currently using the Instree one and having a few extra pimples that are not normal"
"I really wish it worked for me since the finish is super nice, but it makes the skin around my eyes burn like I just rubbed a hot pepper on my face :("
it stung my skin and broke me out unfortunately. i got a bunch of close comedones as well. it also gave me this weird redness with a bunch of bumps around the sides of my nostrils like a perioral dermatitis.
i love this sunscreen! it’s the only one that doesn’t make me break out. it’s super lightweight and hydrating and doesn’t leave a white cast.
"It hasn’t made me break out, but I do notice pilling (peeling?) about an hour or so after applying, mostly around my chin/jawline. Disappointing because I really like the finish overall and heard such amazing things!"
"I have really sensitive skin and it's probably my favourite sunscreen so far. It's really light and doesn't leave my skin oily. When you apply it initially you can feel the product on your skin, but after a few minutes it settles and I don't feel anything."
I loved the feel of it but it would seriously break me out only hours after application. I tried to give in another when the breakout was mostly calm and it just broke out a ton. It makes me so sad because the application is nice. I was thinking I was breaking out because I don’t double cleanse regularly… but this broke me out only within a few hours.
"I love it, but only use it for winter/cooler months. I live in Australia and in the summer it gets hot and humid, so I want something with more staying power in those months to be sure I'm getting the protection! I'm totally loving the texture and finish for winter though - will definitely repurchase!"
"It did break me out :( Not all over horrible but definitely got some nodules / cysts. But I must admit I usually don’t even tolerate mineral filter sunscreens that well, let alone chemical, but with some of the new chemical filters and the praise it’d gotten I wanted to give it a shot. It would break me out, I’d stop for a week, try again, but it was the culprit and I had to stop using it. Ugh the amount of excess sunscreens I have right now from none of them being the right fit!! Still on the hunt for my perfect one"
I haven't used this sunscreen but i know someone who started breaking out after using this sunscreen and had to stop.
It didn’t make me break out but I do have an issue with the sunscreen pilling if I have any products underneath even if I wait 30 min between the last product and sunscreen. I thought the pilling might have been due to whatever product I was applying before sunscreen but I did not have an issue with the round lab sunscreen
"I love it :)! Hydrating and no white cast, farthest feeling from sunscreen possible and with no scent 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼"
It felt nice on my skin but it broke my sister out. At the same time I feel the protection wasn't enough so I didn't repurchase.
I love it and my skin does too (normal to dry skin)
I love it and it hasn’t broke my out personally. I actually feel like it helps heal my skin when I wear it vs the other sunscreens I have. Sounds weird but I notice a difference at the end of the night vs others. I’m dry sensitive acne prone but like anything else everyone’s skin is different but it’s so cheap I feel like it’s worth a shot!
I love it! Feel like my skin has less breakouts. When I tried the isntree hyaluronic acid sunscreen for a week or two in between tubes of BoJ I broke out. Everyone is different but I think it's worth a shot!
it has ferments in it so a big no no for those with fungal acne
I broke out from it ;(
"I'm most likely in the minority when I say I actually find it being slightly too sticky on my bare face. With the two finger method, it takes me a while to really work the amount into my skin. The tackiness never also really settles for me, and it's slightly a little too dewy for my personal liking so I always have to do a light layer of powder on my face afterwards."

"This has good reviews. I already bought one and regretted right after seeing the rice ingredient.
I didn’t read the ingredients before checking out. I broke out badly with Cosrx rice moisturizer so I guess, I might break out with it"
I broke out from it Dont know if its niacinamide
"I broke out from it :( so sad because I really like how light and hydrating it is, but it definitely broke out my forehead and my neck (!!). So I'll just use it on my arms"
"Ive seen a few posts saying similar things on the Asian Beauty sub - that this sunscreen doesn't suit ultra sensitive skin. Even though I've seen many people calling it their HG, the handful of reviews warning that it can cause stinging sensations for sensitive skin were enough for me to take this off my list :( 

Sorry it didn't suit you, hope your skin recovers soon. I guess use it up on body skin if that's not sensitive."
"I understand the pain. I have combination skin that is sensitive and prone to acne. 

A lot of cult fav products did not work on me and broke me out. Cosrx snail muicin, Clinique moisturizer, Biore UV (although I loved the texture). 

What I do to minimize the money wastage because of such products that did not suit my face, I use them on my body like my clinique moisturizer is now an expensive décolletage cream haha. 

Your Beauty of Joseon can be an expensive hand cream. Our exposed areas of the body need sunscreen too. 😅"
That sunscreen is the ONLY one that works on my face. Everything else itches and burns and feels too heavy. But not boj.
"I had similar experience. My skin is not sensitive and has good tolerance. This is the first product to give me a burning sensation. I gave few tries initially then stopped using and restarted again, suddenly it was not burning again, but after using it continuously for few more days the burning sensation is back, even though it goes away in 3-5 minutes. I think it’s the rice extract which is the culprit in my case."
"Thankfully, I actually got samples with my purchase from beautybarn for both boj and isntree ones... The boj one stung on my face while isntree watery sun gel was great, so i got the isntree one instead of this ... There was actually a video from Doctorly comparing the 2 ...while Dr Shah was okay with boj , isntree one didn't work for him where as Dr Max got stinging from boj but not from isntree...i have read similar reviews on r/Asianbeauty as well... Skincare is soo subjective,so it's ymmv ...so samples or mini sizes are safer to use for time time like any other new skincare ... Unfortunately we don't always have options for that 😞 .. i wish we could all get options to buy mini or receive more testing samples with purchase 🤞"
"BoJ sunscreen has fermented product it may not be ideal for acne prone skin. Only reason, I'm not buying it. I stay away from all type of fermented product."
"I once used glycolic acid on my face and it damaged the barrier. I got red rashes and itching and burning. 

The thing is that these sunscreens are chemical sunscreens. So they get absorbed. They are to be treated like an active ingredient. 

If from any product your skin becomes sensitive, you need to switch to physical sunscreen. 

It is a sign that you're skin is being overloaded with actives. 

If you don't want to waste the product just use it after a month. After changing up and slowing down your existing routine. 

Had the same experience with isntree but after one month it's fine. 

Also once you break that barrier you need to reintroduce all products. Just a reminder that don't just resume old regimen with actives."
It has niacinamide. Are you sensitive to it?

This is one of my favorites! I’m on my second tube already :) sorry it didn’t work for you
"It's always so interesting to read reviews on this sunscreen. Just received mine about a month ago. Dry, sensitive skin prone to eczema which is currently well controlled. No issues with niacinamide, I am sensitive to alcohols. I appreciate the ease of this sunscreen, I can slap it on and it sinks in beautifully. Works well under makeup, no pilling. Perfect for days I can't be bothered to work in my tinted Colorscience. My mother also uses this without issue, however she rarely has issues with skincare irritating her (normal, resilient/unreactive skin and the opposite of mine)."
"My skin type: Oily combination, slightly dry cheeks and oily T-zone. My skins leans to more oily in hot weathers. I have large pores around my nose area and I struggle with occasional tiny bumps on my forehead. I would say that I have a medium sensitivity to skincare products as I have been lacking using chemical exfoliation these days.

Climate: hot and humid

Review of sunscreen: 

Packaging:
The packaging is like a large oil paint tube which can be good and bad: good because that means you can squeeze out every single bit of product properly and the tube is made out of metal, i think aluminum or something. Bad because some people might prefer a flip up cap but this is a screw off and the dispensing area is exactly like an oil paint tube and could be messy for some people.

Sunscreen texture:
The texture is light and creamy but doesn't feel heavy, greasy or difficult to spread. A little goes a decently long way and its easy to spread and blend into the skin without lookin streaky. When you're blending the sunscreen in, there is a bit of a hydrating watery feeling that goes away once the product is fully blended in. I'd say that it's sufficiently hydrating for my skin type that I can skip moisturizer and use this as a 2-in-1 moisturizer+sunscreen. But if you have a drier skin type you might want to use moisturizer before this. There is also no scent to the product.

Finish:
The finish is not too matte but not too dewy so I would say maybe a natural or semi-matte finish. My skin doesn't feel oily or greasy. Another thing to note is that I personally felt my eyelids and the pore areas beside my nose were burning every time I used this product. But if you use less product it wouldn't burn as much. The hot sensation usually goes away after about 3-5mins. It didn't sting my eyeballs but it did make my eyelids feel hot.

Verdict: I would not purchase this sunscreen again mainly because of the burning sensation I felt every time I used this. But I do adore the texture so much so I wished it worked for me. The cheapest price I found on Lazada is RM42 for 50ml which is pricey but common for most korean sunscreens.

Rating: 3.5/5 stars"
"Personally, I didn’t like this sunscreen either. I really wanted to though because I liked the overall texture of it and it had no smell. This sunscreen would dry me out so badly after a few hours and it made me break out after using it for a couple of days."
same! i felt burn several times once a apply this product and i think it's because my skin is dehydrated hm anyways i purchased skin aqua gold essence and IT WAS SO GOOD!! i recommend this for everyone who loved boj's sunscreen but stings upon application
"My skin: Combination (oily T-zone) but prone to dehydration. sensitive af

I reaaaally wanted to love this but unfortunately after a few days of testing one half of my face with it, I ended up with very red bumps so obvs am allergic to something within. I'm usually great with niacinamide so it could be the rice extracts.

I'll stick with my fave Isntree hyaluronic acid watery sun gel for now. I found the finish under makeup from BoJ was good but not as good as the Isntree btw."
I get pissed because 50ml is simply NOT ENOUGH sunscreen for those of us who are applying it right. Like...my Sun Aqua in the 180 ml bottle is great...1 full pump for my whole face. These weak ass 50ml tubes are robbery. 2 finger lengths for the face...this SPF seems like it only has about 4 finger lengths in the bottle.
This gives my skin a slight white cast sadly
Honestly this is the most elegant formula I've tried besides the Purito 16 SPF one haha. They did testing in Spain and Korea so the SPF should be accurate if anyone is worrying about that.
"Skin type: combination, acne prone

I wanted to like this sunscreen so bad! I loved everything about it but it broke me out (just a few small red dots). I wonder if it was the niacinamide or the rice extract? I’ve used both those ingredients in different products and it did not cause a reaction.

I’m currently using the Purito daily go to sunscreen and the inisfree matte sunscreen."
"This sunscreen is just okay to me, I prefer using a more mattifying one bc I have oily skin 🥶 But I do like using it specifically for my hands and I think I’ll be repurchasing it just for that hahaha."
"Too oily for my combination skin now, otherwise good"
"I also wasn't a fan of this sunscreen. I think it was the *niacinamide* and the *probiotics* that caused a bad reaction to my skin. I would always get a bunch of comedones whenever I used it. It's a shame too because I really liked how it felt on my skin.

I recommend trying **Dr. G - Green Mild Up Sun+**! I've been using that one for the past few days and I've really been loving it. It does have a slight white cast though."
"I'm at least halfway through my own tube of this and I realized that I don't like this. I have oily, dehydrated, and sensitive skin in a hot humid environment. It does feel a little thick, more similar to a lot of cosmetically inelegant sunscreens than a lot of AB sunscreens I've tried. If you have dry skin, you might appreciate this more but it was too much for me. It also takes a while to rub it in and for me it seems like there's a little bit of a white cast with a shiny finish. The biggest con for me though is that after application it does actually sting! I thought it was just the extra amount of rubbing that I had to do to apply it but I was surprised to read that OP experienced it too. WNRP."

I heard so many good things about it. I am hoping to try it soon.
"I won’t buy it again either. I live in a hot and humid climate and bought it recently to try after seeing people rave about it. It didn’t irritate my super sensitive, eczema prone, skin at all, but it left a white cast."
Love this stuff!
"I love this 😭😭❤️ also a shoutout to etude sunprise sunscreen which I tried today and I love as well. It’s not scent free, a light floral scent. But if someone out there wants a somewhat otherwise dupe to try but didn’t work out with BoJ, try this :)"
"This sunscreen also caused a slight burning sensation for me, although it faded after 10 or so minutes. I also found it didn’t work well under my makeup. I used up the whole tube because it didn’t cause me to break out and I rarely wear makeup. 

I’ve moved on to the Benton Air Fit UV Defense Cream and it hasn’t caused any stinging or irritation! It does seem to take a little longer to work into my skin, but otherwise I’m happy with it for now."
"Thanks so much for your review OP! reading this after I purchased 2 tubes on jolse without ever trying it is definitely making me nervous ahaha. My go to at the moment it the isntree hyaluronic acid sunscreen, but I’m worried its going to be *too* dewy for the summer."
"I love this! But I go through it way too fast. 
Nice to see your review on it!"
I like the idea of matte finish but a lot of products that leave matte finish makes my skin texture look… weird.
"Oh I really hope I like this sunscreen! I got a good deal on a 5pk so I bought it with without trying. Does anyone know the percentage of niacinamide? 

Worse comes to worse I’ll give it to my mom. She loves AB spf but doesn’t online shop so I am her sunscreen dealer"
"i love the texture, how it blends in easily, doesn’t have any scent, and the finish!! i also experienced burning sensation when using it i’m not sure if my skin had to get used to it but i don’t get that tingling/burning feeling anymore?? my barrier wasn’t compromised but i’ve used more hydrating products underneath!"
"I really wanted to like it (iam still unsure), after wearing it awhile, my skin starts being soo oily and some acne spots appear and afew days after ill have a seasonal oily areas (in a normal season for me-eczema). Idk why though. Yes i do live in a hot and humid weather, i dont thinl thats the problem seeing my face isnt too oily on a normal basis these days."
I just used this for the first time today and I was so excited. It burned around my nose and eyes so badly!! I hate a face sunscreen you can’t use near or around you eyes. What is the point of that??? I prefer the CosRx aloe sunscream but still looking for an AB mineral only face sunscreen
"i’m really upset at this product tbh. While I love the finish, it BURNS/STINGS my eyes. I’m not particularly sensitive to niacinamide or have sensitive skin, also leaning more on the dry side, but I wouldn’t rebuy because of that burning sensation, probably will use it for the rest of my body or somethin’. :( Really wanted to love this product, but not for me. I checked the mirror where the burning was on my eyelids and where it burnt the most, there’s spots on it now :(("
"I'm so glad this isn't just me! It started burning and the 2 products I had used beforehand both had centella in them, so I have no idea what the issue is here. It makes me sad though, because the finish is great."
"Tinsorb M is an amazing sunscreen filter, sadly it stings a little upon application and for some it’s unbearable. This is probably why some people couldn’t handle this sunscreen."
"I get the sting as well, and I really want to continue with this sunscreen. So I will wait the 15min before applying it after skincare and see. Hope it works... Combination dry skin..."
"One question, where did you buy it? I've been trying but I can't find it"
Did you happen to workout with this? I hate being at the gym and having my eyes sting
"Glad to know that I wasn't the only one experiencing the stinging. This product was raved about everywhere and none of the ingredients as far as I know, I was particularly sensitive too. I have dry skin and eczema (my face isn't as sensitive as the rest of my body), and I noticed that with the Korean products I tried, I do get that stinging effect, though this one isn't as bad as my previous one, my previous sunscreen left me tearing up. I think it might be one of the Korean UV filters that just doesn't sit right with my skin. I'm glad however that my skin did not suffer from any redness and the sting does eventually go away after a few minutes of wear. But for the price, which in my country is considered expensive, I don't think I will repurchase it despite the beautiful after feel."

"It’s one of my favorites! It works really well for me. It’s not for sports related activities or hiking or a day out at the beach, just so you know. You’ll see a recent post about it where someone tried to use it for this purpose and didn’t reapply and got sunburnt"
"Fun fact: A lot of people don’t know that it isn’t actually popular in korea! 🤣 it just blew up on tiktok one day and blessed the brand with tons of overseas sales, way more than what a small business like them could’ve gotten locally. They were smart to make their brand so accessible outside of korea.

For what it’s worth i like it better than several other popular korean sunscreens anyway, like Round Lab, which it is supposedly a dupe for. Depending on where you are in the world or which site you’re buying it from, it’s also a lot cheaper than Round Lab (which can be a lot more expensive internationally, esp outside of Asia)

Fav part is the healthy glowy look it leaves under light makeup. Least fav part is the way it creases under eyelids so i always have to watch out there. Not as lightweight as i would’ve liked it."
"I really like it. It's one of the few more moisturizing sunscreens I can handle having oily skin and not being a big fan of the dewy look on myself. 

I don't live in the sunniest climate so I can't say how well it works in intense UV, but for day to day life it's nice. I set it with a makeup setting powder too and it stays in place and doesn't run off or into my eyes that way."
"Apparently this is going to be a unpopular opinion but i didn't really like it. It sensitized my skin especially around my eyes to the point my skin there would be painful even on the next day and i also didn't like the consistency of it.
It took me forever to get it set so that i wouldn't have any White streaks on my skin but it would mever completely set. Sometimes, hours after i applied it I would have White streaks on my face, where the sunscreen moved around. I didn't have that Problem when I would wear makeup, though"
Unfortunately it made me break out. I have combo and very sensitive skin. It made me so sad bc I love the texture so much.
I love it! It doesn’t sting my eyes. I find it fairly hydrating so sometimes I even skip moisturizer because I don’t want to look too greasy. I also really appreciate that it doesn’t have a scent. I’m on my second tube!
"It's ok but I found it 'heavy' an I have dry skin so my skin loves hydrating products.  It doesn't leave a white cast, it is hydrating but I just found that it 'sat' on my skin so i actually started using it for my hands."
"It’s a good everyday light sunscreen. It’s not suitable for strong sun or outdoor activity, but for school or work as an everyday day sunscreen  with frequent reapplication it’s really nice. Sinks in, works great under makeup and no white cast"
"I like how it feels on the skin, and I think it might make a good everyday sunscreen, but it isn't waterproof and I won't trust it for serious outdoor protection until I can find some third party testing data."
"It’s good but it’s not my favorite. It pilled on my skin, even without my skincare underneath it. It’s not the worst culprit of pilling- the CosRx aloe one was waaaay worse- but it pills enough to be annoying."
"take this with a grain of salt bc this is the first and only AB sunscreen i’ve ever tried. but i am really picky with sunscreens. i’ve tried tons of western sunscreens and none checked all my boxes. here are my requirements: 
- moisturizing/dewy, but not greasy
- chemical filters/no white cast
- no sunscreen smell
- no pilling/weird texture
- doesn’t break me out
- doesn’t bother my sensitive skin
- doesn’t sting my eyes 
- wears well under makeup

the BOJ sunscreen checks all those boxes for me so i’m on my second tube of it. i don’t feel the need to try anything else right now because of how much i’m enjoying it. though it would be cool to find another that checks all my boxes!"
I like it but it leaves a white cast on me. I build up layers over the day too and it starts to pill
The thing I like the most about it is that it feels very thin and lightweight. Luckily I haven't had any bad reactions to it. I like to use it for daily use and under makeup. I bought 4 extra tubes during a stylevana sale for about $7\~ a tube.
Love it. Works wonderfully for my dry skin. Gives me a nice glow too.
"This one made my face burn - I think it was the niacinamide, which was sad because I liked the texture. I’m using either Purito every day sunscreen or skin aqua milk. I have dry, sensitive skin and I don’t need a moisturizer under the Purito and it’s fine when I dust with a translucent powder. A lot of people thought it was too heavy tho. The skin aqua is great but really small and watery, but the finish is nicer. I’m using different ones for outdoor activities."
"It stung me the first time I tried it, but I kept using it and discovered it stings on the days after I use retinol or exfoliate and don't moisturize well"
I like it but it collects in my neck and eye creases/smile lines throughout the day. Trying to find a replacement for that reason!
It’s good! I’m tan and it doesn’t leave a white cast. I have oily skin and it gets dewy on me throughout the day. I definitely have to powder/use setting spray when wearing it under makeup. For everyday use it’s nice. I will look for an SPF that’s better for oil control next
"Great for me for day-to-day, no sweating/strenuous exercise. Doesn't sting my eyes. Hydrating for my dry-ish skin. I could see how it may be too greasy/dewy for anyone with combo/oily skin though. Can't speak to white cast as I have east-Asian toned skin."
"I have dry, dehydrated, sensitive skin and I hated it!
 
Sure it made my skin feel soft on the surface but it felt dried out. I don't know if this makes sense but my skin felt like it had a layer of lotion on top but nothing soaked into my skin. (There's a video where a guy puts a cup of water on top of dry soil patch and wet soil where the water doesn't soak into the dry soil. It felt like that)

[example video ](https://youtu.be/urQHsOmoKLg)

 I also got really itchy like when my face is dried out during the winter."
I’m dark in complexion and it leaves a pretty apparent white cast on me.
Broke me out :(
I feel like I'm the only person who doesn't like this... or really any of the popular sunscreens manufactured by Kolmar.  They work fine on my face but all of them pill horribly on my neck.  I'm not interested in having one SPF for my face and having to use another for my neck so they're all hard passes for me.  I'm using up the ones I bought on my arms.
"I started using this and I'm really enjoying it so far!

I had to take a break from sunscreen because my previous, long-term HG broke me out (could be because my skin was severely dehydrated, dry, and thin).

So now that I'm starting sunscreens again, I've had a few options.

Round Lab birch sunscreen for some reason  really irritated my skin. No redness, but it stung and made my skin itch in some places. Was really anxious about trying BoJ since the ingredients are nearly identical but I'm glad I did! I'm going to keep an eye on this one but so far I'm loving it."
AMAZING! Will repurchase again and again.
It’s perfect. Luxurious finish
"I've been using it recently. Cosmetically elegant, it doesn't make my skin oily or give me CCs like some sun screens. It's well worth the price IMO."
"Your post came at a great time, OP! 

I've been using it around a week and it's my favorite so far. Extremely lightweight for my acne-prone and dry and dehydrated skin. 

It didn't leave a white cast, nor did it make my skin dull. :)"
"Applies nicely but unfortunately it broke me out, gave me lots of closed comedones and made my skin look more textured than before. I stopped using it and my skin went back to being nice and happy again. 
I can’t work out which ingredient is causing this as my skin likes fermented skincare, not ultra sensitive, no known reaction to niacinamide. 🤷‍♀️"
Would love to try but it isn’t waterproof so I know I’d just sweat it ALL off 😭
"It's been my latest favorite. I have bad melasma on my upper lip and I play beach volleyball, so I'm constantly in the sun. This sunscreen has done REMARKABLE to keep my melasma from getting worse, and has actually helped it fade away (by providing protection, ofc...it doesn't actually treat melasma). I have super sensitive eyes when it comes to sunscreen, especially because I sweat pretty badly, and this stuff will not burn your eyes and stays on really well. I highly recommend it! I'm actually restocking on it right now :)  


oh! and my skin is prone to breaking out when it comes to sunscreens and this one does not cause any breakouts."
"I'm a runner and I sweat like a beast. Seriously, I should be studied. 

If I wasn't running that day, it was pretty nice. Applied nicely. No break outs. But if I was running? It STUNG my eyes so much and turned into a slimy mess even if it had been hours since I applied it. Definitely not for activity and not the best at preventing burns"
"I really like it but I will say two things- after reapplying more than once, things get thick and peely. Also it makes all of my foundation bright orange oddly.


So as much as I like it, I probably won't rebuy it."
"Nice.  Sort of like a light lotion/milk texture and no fragrance and gentle.  I like it.  Sometimes I had some sensitivity some days if I used it after a vitamin c serum.  Nothing that lasted.  It's moisturizing but not heavy.  However, I am dry skinned."
"EXTREMELY overrated. Great for those with lighter skin tones but on darker skin tones it has a white cast (even though every reviewer says it doesn't 👎) and it’s not oil resistant. I bought mine, put it on a quarter of my face before saying “hell no.” and returning it. Please do better beauty community."

"i'm on my third tube! i love it because it has no whitecast, and doesn't sit like an oily layer on my skin. my skin absorbs it nicely, like a moisturiser and it wears very well for me (granted, i'm indoors most of the time). when my skin becomes oilier (usually around my period) i set it with powder, and it looks wonderful throughout the day."
"On my N21-23 skin, I do notice a very slight white cast when I first put it on but it seems to clear up soon after. It’s a thick but moisturizing formula with a more watery finish than greasy, which I like. Makeup goes on pretty well. It’s only slightly dewy imo (as opposed to D’Alba white truffle which I find a bit too dewy)."
Following!
"for me it's an ok sunscreen. I like it on the majority of my face but i have to be very careful with my eyes: if i haven't moisturized properly before applying it starts stinging a lot. I had days in which I had to wash my face all over. I guess was user error, but i must also note that other sunscreen never gave me this problem (one for all: canmake mermaid gel)"
"Been using it on and off but I introduced it at the same time I introduced the isntree sun stick and unfortunately  I’ve been breaking out a little. I think it’s either this or the sun stick, that’s breaking me out a little with a few blackheads and closed comedones :(. I know BOJ is very light on ingredients so hoping it’s the sun stick and not BOJ cause I really like it."
I have been wondering about this sunscreen too! I’ve been wanting to try it but I’m scared it might be too dewy for my oily skin. These comments definitely helped me thanks guys 🖤
"I liked it more than Isntree! I found the latter made me very shiny on my video work calls but the BOJ one wears really nicely for me.

Im currently in Seoul on a trip and it’s not a popular brand here and hard to actually find BOJ in stores - I’ll be trying Round Lab next ☺️"
"Oily/dehydration-prone/reactive skin

Pros: It sinks in beautifully and lets me go without any additional moisturizer, love that it’s fragrance free. Cons: It can make the area around my eyes sting if I’m not careful with application and unfortunately I think it’s making my neck breakout, of all places."
"I usually find these types of suncreens too heavy / greasy, but it's been surprisingly not too much for my oily skin.

It's also quite nice under makeup even after a whole day."
"I have normal-ish skin but it can lean a bit dry, and I found it was not moisturizing enough for my liking. I like the glowy/ glazed donut look and this sunscreen does initially give me that effect but it’s gone within the hour."
"i like it a lot, its lightweight and feels like its just a moisturizer on my (sensitive combo to oily) skin, im already on my 3rd or 4th bottle which is taking an awfully long time to ship. would repurchase over and over again."
The only sunscreen I will ever use ever.
"I like it but it always sets in my eyelid crease so I have to check and make sure it didn’t 😭. Also I don’t think it’s for sensitive skinned people. Like my skin barrier was damaged because of a prescription I was on and it stung to put on the product, not horribly but a fair bit."
"it's light enough for a daily sunscreen, but it pills on me :( i have drier skin and I don't think it's particularly oily or wet on my skin. I wouldn't trust it for serious sun protection though, i find korean sunscreen formulas to be less protective overall. I'm still using it for my day to day since i work in an office and not under direct sunlight"

"I love it!! At the time of writing this i've been using it every day for almost 2 months and i wouldnt change it for another.

 I think this tube will last me another month or so (right now the uv index where i live is around 1-2 so i only apply it in the morning) and i already bought back-ups. Its my first AB sunscreen, i switched from using a non AB one that was recommended to me, and i find the texture to be much more pleasant. Its not oily at all, which is good because i dont like the look and feel of greasy sunscreens, doesnt have a scent and it feels so smooth and moisturizing on my face. It doesnt leave a white cast on me, but my skin is on the medium-fair side.My skin overall looks much better when i use it. 

Personally i didnt have an issue with pilling with this sunscreen, neither on my face nor on my neck, which was a relief because the main reason i switched from my last non AB sunscreen was the pilling.

(For reference, i have normal skin, but i tend to look oily at the end if the day, around my T zone, if i use a heavy, greasy sunscreen)"
"Makes my skin too greasy. I was so excited to use it. No, everytime I use it, I have to use setting powder."
